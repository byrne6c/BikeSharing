## Overview of the analysis: 
* The purpose of this analysis is to use public Citi Bike data in August for NYC, create a proposal on how Bike Share concept would work in Des Moines, IA.

The purpose of this story is to help potential stakeholders determine whether they should invest in a bike-sharing program in the city of Des Moines.

## Results:

We can see from visualization 3, throughout the Weekdays 7am-9am & 5pm-7pm are the most popular timeframe for bike usage. On the Weekends, bike usage is spread out throughout the day (10am-7pm).

Visualization 4: Popular Bike Checkout Times per Weekday Based on Gender.

From visual 4, coincides with visualizations 2 & 3, showing the heaviest frequency of Bike usage is contributed by Male users on the weekdays, between the hours of 7am-9am & 5pm-7pm.

Visualization 5: User Type by Gender & Weekly Usage.

From visual 5, we can determine the majority of Bike Share users are Male & Subscribers of the Bike Share service. 

Visualization 6: Peak Hours of Bikes Used in August.

Visualzation 5 easily reflects which hours of a day the Bikes are mostly inactive. We can clearly determine that from 2am-4am bikes not in use. 

Visuaization 7: Popular Starting Locations VS Popular Ending Locations for Bike Trips.

Visualization 7 shows us that Majority of Bike Trips begin & end within the same general radius & that we can assume distance traveled between start to finish is within a limited range. This also coincides with Trip duration lasting no more that 1 hour at a time. 

## Summary: 
  After reviewing the visualizations above, we can conclude successful factors behind Bike Share service include Asscessability between bike locations, Users find a subscription to Bike Share services more suitable that pay per ride, and bike maintenance would best be performed between the hours of 2am-4pm when Bike are less likely in use by a rider. 

  Suggested Visualizations include: 
    1) A Stakeholder may want to specify durability before investing. I would suggest collecting data on frequency of bike maintenance and cross-reference this withe Bike ID data, amount of usage & location of use. We can then produce a bar or map visualization. 
    2) A Stakeholder may be interested in frequent use of bike location per day. From collecting this data we can assess amount of active vs inactive bikes used per location. An area map would be most useful for this type of visualization.
